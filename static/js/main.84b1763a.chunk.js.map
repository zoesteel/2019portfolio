I also improved my skills in WordPress, creating templates and pages using PHP. For this project we employed a Kanban methodology, using two week sprints. My favourite part about this redesign is how much of a departure it is from the previous site, with a much more refreshed and clean design.</p>\n\n        <p>The previous site was busy looking and not at all responsive, with a difficult to navigate menu:</p>\n\n        <img src=\"images/radialold.jpg\" alt=\"Radial Engineering old website design\" className=\"project-img\" />\n        \n        <p>The new site features a search function and easily filtered products.

In 2017, with new products hitting the market, my team was tasked with creating a website for Dynaco. Once the designer mocked up the design, I helped to put together the site. During this process I learned how to use Git and command line. The site is fully responsive, using Bootstrap 3. I really like the colours of the design and feel that the overall look of the site reflects the high quality products of the Dynaco brand. </p>\n            <img src=\"images/dynaco.jpg\" alt=\"Dynaco website\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n            <p className=\"tools\">Tools used: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Git, Bootstrap </p> \n            <Link to=\"/\" className=\"homelink\">\n                &lt; Back \n            </Link>\n        </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Dynaco;","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction Dogwood() {\n  return (\n        <div>\n            <h3 className=\"project-title\">Dogwood Rescue Society</h3>\n                \n            <p>This was my final project at BCIT. In a group of 3, we created a fully responsive and accessible WordPress theme, using the Underscores.me starter theme, for a dog rescue. After our initial meeting with the client, we began by planning the information architecture. Next, we moved to the design phase, where I particularly had a lot of input and was able to redesign the rescue’s logo.</p>\n\n            <p>This was the organisation’s previously used logo:</p>\n\n            <img src=\"images/dogwood-old-logo.jpg\" alt=\"Dogwood Rescue old logo design\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n            <p>I updated and cleaned up the existing logo according to the client’s preferences.

Particularly time consuming was making the site responsive. In the future I would design something like this for mobile first.</p>\n\n            <p>I’m proud of the outcome and happy that I got to make a website for a cause I fully support.</p>\n\n            <p>As of July 2019 the site is still not live due to issues on the client’s side but I will be working with them to get it online ASAP.</p>\n\n            <img src=\"images/dogwood.jpg\" alt=\"Dogwood Rescue website\" className=\"project-img\" />\n            <img src=\"images/dogwood-1.jpg\" alt=\"Dogwood Rescue adoption page\" className=\"project-img\" width=\"40%\" />\n\n\n            <p className=\"tools\">Tools used: WordPress, PHP, CSS, JavaScript, Photoshop, Illustrator</p>\n            \n            <Link to=\"/\" className=\"homelink\">\n                &lt; Back \n            </Link>\n        </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Dogwood;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction InwardEdward() {\n  return (\n        <div>\n            <a href=\"http://inwardedward.com\" target=\"_new\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" className=\"project-title\">\n               Inward Edward\n            </a>\n           \n            <p>I created a child theme for the WordPress theme OneTone, for an independent musical short, Inward Edward. This film will be shown at film festivals around the world.</p>\n\n            <p>This was my first attempt at using Bootstrap and it was a good introduction to it although I could have used it more effectively. The design was heavily influenced by the parent theme with modifications from the client. I like the colour scheme, the parallax effect and the fade in scroll effect (using jQuery). I enjoy the overall look and feel of the site which reflects the style of the musical. However, although the site is made with WordPress, the news section is not easily editable by the client, which would be much more convenient. Being somewhat inexperienced with WordPress this site took a lot longer than I would have liked, and I ran into problems with the client’s limitations on the server side, but it was a good learning experience.</p>\n\n            <img src=\"images/inwardedward.jpg\" alt=\"Inward Edward movie website\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n            <img src=\"images/inwardedward-1.jpg\" alt=\"Inward Edward movie website\" className=\"project-img\" />\n\n            <p className=\"tools\">Tools used: WordPress, Bootstrap 3, jQuery, Flexbox, Photoshop</p>\n\n            <Link to=\"/\" className=\"homelink\">\n                &lt; Back \n            </Link>\n        </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default InwardEdward;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Switch, withRouter } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport Header from './Header';\nimport Home from './Home';\nimport Footer from './Footer';\nimport Portfolio from './Portfolio';\nimport Radial from './Radial';\nimport JimRhodes from './JimRhodes';\nimport Dynaco from './Dynaco';\nimport Dogwood from './Dogwood';\nimport InwardEdward from './InwardEdward';\n\nimport './App.css';\n\nclass App extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            \n            <div className=\"Portfolio\">     \n                <div className=\"wrapper\">\n                    <Header />\n                    <div className=\"content\">  \n                    <HashRouter basename='/'>          \n                        <Switch>\n                            <Route exact path=\"/\" component={Home} />\n                            <Route path=\"/portfolio\" component={Portfolio} />\n                            <Route path=\"/radial\" component={Radial} />\n                            <Route path=\"/jimrhodes\" component={JimRhodes} />\n                            <Route path=\"/dynaco\" component={Dynaco} />\n                            <Route path=\"/dogwood\" component={Dogwood} />\n                            <Route path=\"/inwardedward\" component={InwardEdward} />\n                        </Switch>    \n                    </HashRouter>        \n                    </div>{/* end content  */}\n                </div>{/* end wrapper */}\n                <Footer />\n            </div>\n        )\n    }\n}\nexport default withRouter(App);","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
